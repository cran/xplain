# xplain

This package allows to provide live interpretations and explanations of statistical 
functions in R. These interpretations and explanations are shown when the explained function 
is called by the user. They can interact with the values of the explained function's actual 
results to offer relevant, meaningful insights. The xplain interpretations and explanations 
are based on an easy-to-use XML format that allows to include R code to interact with the 
returns of the explained function.
